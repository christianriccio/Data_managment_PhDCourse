# Data_managment_PhDCourse

This repository contains the final exam material for the Data Management PhD course.
In particular, the objective of the test was to launch SQL queries on a database of our choice which possibly concerned the domain of competence of each PhD student.
I decided to use traffic data, and specifically I referred to the California SWITRS (Statewide Integrated Traffic Record System) database which collects information about traffic collisions that occurred in California.
The data used is not present in the repository as it far exceeds the maximum size of 25MB. To download them, you need to refer to the official site where the database is hosted.
Specifically, these data range from 2001 to 2020 and collect all kinds of information regarding traffic collisions that have been reported to the police.
For a detailed description of the whole project, I invite you to refer to the .pdf documentation that accompanies the jupyter notebook and the Utils.py file.
More precisely:
- Utils.py is a simple python class that implement some methods used during the analysis
- FinalExam.jpynb is the jupyter notebook of the project where some queries on the data are shown and some comments are given
